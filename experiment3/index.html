				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Made a procedural generation of two elemeents, an Overworld and a basic dungeon plot.
					The goal was to simulate a game world which is randomly generated each time creating variation. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The project was built using P5.js and a tilesheet image to create the world. For the overworld generation
					I created the grass tiles were the default being with Water always being surrounded by dirt. There was a river generation using Perlin noise for some curves.
					For the Dungeon created a large room in the center first and then surrounded it with other random rooms with constraints to not overlap.
					They are then connected with L shaped hallways.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The Experiment helped me understand generation better and the need to plan many things out. There were several difficulties that I encountered such as making the rooms connecting 
					properly within the dungeons. Overal it was a interesting experiment. Also trying to implement a way for both projects to show up 
					gave me a headache.
