				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Generated infinite procedural islands with dynamic terrain with beacheas, ocean, rocky shores
					and grassy land. Elevation is the main element that changes what everything looks like especially with the differences of biomes.
				The underwater sea map was just a map of a underwater world, with deeper oceans , coral reefs, cliffs, and sandy seafloors. 
				It also has small dynamic fishes swimming randomly in the deeper parts, scattered buildings of a aquatic lifeform. Lastly the civilization world 
			is a infinite continent with mountains(ice and rocky) grass lands, and lakes. Also made it so the map was zoomed out so you could view it like a game where
		you can just oversee the world. There are clouds because of this reason. Also have the ability to swap between the worlds at will by clicking 1-3 on your keyboard. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p> The overworld uses Perlin noise to create and determine elevation with a certain distance check from islands. Depending on the elevation decides what is the tile for all 3 maps. 
					Dynamic elements such as coral was implemented inside the underwater map, if the player clicks a certain amount of times they can spawn larger coral. There are generated shapes 
				resembling small fish swimming around the sea floor, the underwater map also has a blue tint over the screen to have underwater resmeblence. Lastly the Civilized world is a zoomed out version to give it a map feeling.
			  Cities are generated together as buildings generate in clusters. The clouds were generated after and would generate above the landscape and drift the opposite direction of the camera. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p> From all 3 maps I learned alot about noise and elevation especially when creating the basis for all three of my worlds.
					 Learning the combinations needed to make a more natural landscape especially with the distance. Spawning to much clutter would sometimes overwhelme the canvas so a careful balance of 
					size plus amount was the correct approach. Learned how to make a tile come out to make it look 3d. Drawing the faces in a different order would change how it looked. Changing the values of certain walls made it look like small buildings.  </p>
